Multilabel Classification is a branch of Data Mining in which many different
metrics and equations are defined. Each author uses different notation and
basic definitions, thus difficulting the coherence of future papers where
some of these formulas are used. This is a document where the multilabel
scenario is presented with simple basic definitions, and a list of commonly
used formulas are rigurously adapted to this notation, in an attempt to
introduce them in a clear way.
